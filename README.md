## About This Project
Weather defines the state of the atmosphere during a certain period of time and in a certain area that is uncertain and fluctuating. 
In this journal, we implement Machine Learning algorithms that is Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Na√Øve Bayes (NB), 
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Neural Network algorithm in the form of Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN) to classify weather from images using the Multi-class Weather Dataset (MWD). The aim of this study is 
to compare performance between those six algorithms. We use K-Fold Cross Validation with cv = 5 to validate our model. 
Before predicting the images, we preprocess the images using smoothing and sharpening. From our testing, our model achieves 
68.84% prediction accuracy using DT, 81.99% using RF, 70.91 using NB, 74.47% using KNN, 83.97% using SVM, and 99.87% 
using CNN.
